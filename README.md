 SQL Data Warehouse
Building a Modern Data Warehouse using Medallion Architecture

ðŸ“Š Data Warehouse Project: Structured Data Pipeline with SQL
This project demonstrates a complete Data Warehouse pipeline built using SQL and key data engineering concepts. It involves:

Organizing, Structuring & Preparing Data: Raw data is collected from multiple sources and structured for analysis.

ETL / ELT Processing: Implemented data pipelines using Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) and Extract, Load, Transform (ELT) techniques.

Data Architecture: Designed a star schema with fact and dimension tables to optimize for query performance and analytics.

Data Integration: Merged data from multiple sources (CSV, APIs, etc.) into a unified format.

Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, duplicates, and formatting issues to ensure high-quality data.

Data Load: Loaded the cleaned and transformed data into staging and final warehouse tables.

Data Modeling: Created normalized and denormalized models to support both operational reporting and BI dashboards.
