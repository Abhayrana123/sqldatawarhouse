This project showcases the development of a modern SQL-based Data Warehouse using the Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold) to organize and transform data efficiently for analytics and reporting purposes.

üß± Medallion Architecture
üî∑ Bronze Layer ‚Äì Raw Data Ingestion
Collected raw data from CSV files and simulated APIs

Loaded directly into staging tables with minimal changes

Ensured full data capture for audit and reprocessing

üü° Silver Layer ‚Äì Clean & Transformed Data
Applied data cleaning: removed duplicates, standardized formats

Implemented joins and business logic to create clean data views

Normalized structure for flexibility and data consistency

üíé Gold Layer ‚Äì Analytics-Ready Data
Built fact and dimension tables for reporting

Aggregated data for KPIs and dashboards

Optimized queries for speed using indexes and views

‚öôÔ∏è Tools & Technologies
SQL (PostgreSQL / MySQL / BigQuery ‚Äì depending on setup)

dbt (for data modeling and transformations) (optional)

Python (for ETL orchestration and file handling) (optional)

Power BI / Tableau (for data visualization) 

üë®‚Äçüíª How I Worked on This Project
Step 1: Requirement Understanding
Analyzed the needs of a business analytics system and planned the warehouse schema accordingly.

Step 2: Data Ingestion
Wrote SQL scripts to load raw datasets into the Bronze layer, ensuring data preservation and logging.

Step 3: Data Transformation
Cleaned and transformed data in the Silver layer using SQL procedures and CTEs.

Step 4: Data Modeling
Designed fact and dimension tables using the star schema in the Gold layer to support business queries.

Step 5: Testing & Optimization
Validated the data quality, tested joins, and optimized query performance with indexes and views.

Step 6: Documentation
Added schema diagrams, clear comments in SQL files, and prepared a README for better project understanding.
